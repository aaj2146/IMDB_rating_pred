Predicting the average movie ratings from publicly available data: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/

The notebook contains code as well as documentaion of my approach to predict average movie ratings. Broadly speaking I tried
2 main approaches:

1. Neural Network with Categorical Embeddings
2. Radnom Forest Regressor

The details of the data cleaning, preprocessing and each individual approach with results is discussed in detail in the notebook
